                            <h3>What exactly are cookies?</h3>
                            <div>
                                <p>Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are for example
                                    Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store
                                    small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.
                                </p>
                                <p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly
                                    all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since
                                    there are also different cookies for other uses. http-cookies are small files which
                                    our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put into
                                    the cookie-folder, which is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a
                                    name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be
                                    specified.
                                </p>
                                <p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page
                                    settings. When you re-open our website, your browser submits these “user specific”
                                    information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and
                                    offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its
                                    own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are
                                    created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by
                                    partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is individual, since every
                                    cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can
                                    be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain
                                    no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your
                                    PC’s information.

                            <p>
                                Vercel is a hosting platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to
                                integrate with headless content, commerce, or database.
                                It provides a frictionless developer experience to take care of the hard things:
                                deploying instantly, scaling automatically, and serving personalized content around the
                                globe. It make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user
                                experiences, with a extreme focus on performance.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For working on our website, we required an easy-to-use system, that allows us to present
                                you
                                an interesting design and content quickly and easily. We have found a
                                combination of a headless CMS (Sanity.io) and Vercel to be the right system for this.
                                Vercel’s easy operation and its extensive functions, we can design our
                                website as we wish, while ensuring its user-friendliness.

                                For example, Log Data can help Vercel to detect new threats, identify malicious third
                                parties, and provide more robust
                                security protection for this website.

                                    <li>The right to be informed: Vercel has the obligation to inform you that we
                                        process your
                                        personal data (and that's what we're doing in this Privacy Policy);
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The right of access: your right to request a copy of the personal data Vercel
                                        hold
                                        about you (also known as a 'data subject access request');
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The right of rectification: your right to request that Vercel corrects personal
                                        data
                                        about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first
                                        making any changes in your Account Settings);
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The right to erasure (also known as the 'right to be forgotten'): under certain
                                        circumstances, you may ask Vercel to delete the personal data they have about
                                        you
                                        (unless it remains necessary for us to continue processing your personal data
                                        for a legitimate business need or to comply with a legal obligation as permitted
                                        under the GDPR, in which case we will inform you);
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The right to restrict processing: your right, under certain circumstances, to
                                        ask Vercel to suspend their processing of your personal data;
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The right to data portability: your right to ask Vercel for a copy of your
                                        personal
                                        data in a common format (for example, a .csv file);
                                    </li>
                                    <li> The right to object: your right to object to Vercel processing your personal
                                        data
                                        (for example, if you object to them processing your data for direct marketing);
                                        and
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling: Vercel's
                                        obligation to
                                        be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them.
